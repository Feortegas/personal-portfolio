                <p>
                    My name is Fernando Ortega. I was born in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil in 1984. Growing up in a big city was a great experience, 
                    but, as soon as my adult life started, I decided to move to a much smaller town 500 miles down South.
                    <br>
                    There is where I met my wonderful wife and where my passion for programming started.
                    Since 2004, I have been working for the same company.
                    <br>
                    I spent two years working in the IT department, till I trasnfered to the Industrial Automation department, that's where I started programming in Visual Studio 6 and SQL.
                    <br>
                    A few years later, lots of
                    traveling deploying running programs at customer sites, I decided to porsue a management position at the company's branch in 
                    Minneapolis,USA, but, I didn't want to stay too far away from the developers for too long.
                    <br>
                    I decided to transfer to a 
                    Project Manager position within the Automation team. It was a great experience, but my passion for Software development brought 
                    me back to the Dev team as a Team Leader.
                    <br>
                    Since I took over that position back in 2018, we grew our teams from 10 developers to 35 developers. We also transitioned from 
                    waterfall to Agile development as well as merged the Dev and Ops teams into DevOps teams.
